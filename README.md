# TestWedding
This is a small program project made for my first java class. It uses four seperate source codes, Person, Couple, Wedding, And TestWedding, to set up a couples' wedding. The Person class stores information on a persons' first name, last name, and birthday inside of a Person object. The Couple class will take two Person objects and store them as the bride and groom inside of one Couple object. The Wedding class stores a Couple object, their wedding date, and their wedding location under one Wedding object. Finally TestWedding creates all of the objects for each class and runs the program to get results.

## Classes
Below will be each class as well as a table for each listing its methods and describing what those methods do.

### Person
This class is made up of the String variable firstName, the string variable lastName, and the LocalDate variable birthDate.


| Method | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| Person() | This is the class constructor and will give our variables their values |
| getFirstName() | This method will return the firstName variable |
